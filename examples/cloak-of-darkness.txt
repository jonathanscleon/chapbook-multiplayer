**[[Begin->Outside]]**


:: Outside
room: 'Outside'

Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright lights of the [[Opera House->Foyer]]. It's surprising that there aren't more people about but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...?

[cont'd]
Session Id: {session.id}

Peer Id: {peer.id}

:: Cloak
A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly spattered with raindrops. Its blackness is so deep that it almost seems to suck light from the room.

_previousRoom: room
room: 'Foyer of the Opera House'

[if _previousRoom === 'Outside']
Shaking the rain from your [[cloak->Cloak]], you step gratefully inside.

[cont'd]
You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the [[north->Outside]], and there are doorways [[south->Bar]] and [[west->Cloakroom]].


:: Cloakroom
room: 'Cloakroom'
--
The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now [[only one remains->Cloakroom Hook]].

[if !hasCloak; append]
It holds your [[cloak->Cloak]].

[cont'd]
The exit is a door to the [[east->Foyer]].


:: Cloakroom Hook
It's just a small brass hook, screwed to the wall.

[if $numCloaksHanging > 1]
There are {$numCloaksHanging} other cloaks hanging here.
[if $numCloaksHanging === 1]
There is one other cloak hanging on the hook.
[if hasCloak]
You could [[hang->hang cloak]] your [[cloak->Cloak]] here.
[else]
You could [[pick up your cloak and wear it]], if you like, or simply turn back to the [[cloak room->Cloakroom]].

:: Bar
room: 'Bar'
--
[if hasCloak]
{embed passage: 'Darkness'}

[else]
The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort of [[message->read message]] scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.


:: read message
The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads...

[align center]
_You have won_


:: Darkness
room: 'Darkness'
--
You can't see a thing! Not even the door you entered by--was it [[north->Foyer]], [[south->Darkness 2]], [[east->Darkness 2]] or [[west->Darkness 2]]?


:: Darkness 2
Blundering around in the dark isn't a good idea! You can't tell [[left->Darkness 3]] from [[right->Darkness 3]], let alone [[east->Darkness 3]] from [[west->Darkness 3]] or [[north->Foyer]] from [[south->Darkness 3]].


:: Darkness 3
No, this isn't getting you anywhere... Let's see, the door was [[south->Darkness 4]], wasn't it? So the exit must be [[north->Foyer]], unless you've gotten [[turned around->Darkness 4]].


:: Darkness 4
Oops, this is just a blank wall! But perhaps if you [[follow it around->Foyer]]...
