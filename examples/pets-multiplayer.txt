[cont'd]

A charming, cozy cafe filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.
Near the front, a case full of delicous looking cakes and pastries catches your eye.

But first, you decide to pick an animal companion.

You can see a [[curious cat->Baskerville the Cat]] eyeing you from atop a tall cat tree,
and [[playful cat->Wingdings the Cat]] pawing at a mouse toy on a string.
In the corner, an [[excited bunny->Ada the Bunny]] bounces along the perimeter of a large playpen,
and a [[relaxed bunny->Hershel the Bunny]] lays in the sunbeams.


:: Animal Cafe Intro
--

There's a cute new Animal Cafe in town. You decide to pay it a visit.



:: Hershel the Bunny
--
# Hershel the Bunny

A fluffy tricolor Holland Lop. He flops lazily next to the side of the rabbit hutch.
Hershel reminds you of a plush toy that's come to life. You've never seen an animal so relaxed.

[if !$avaliablePets.hershel]
Hershel isn't available anymore. He must have caught someone else's eye already.

:: Ada the Bunny

# Ada the Bunny

A fuzzy brown mini rex. She zooms excitedly around the pen.
Ada looks like a bunny straight from a picture book.
You think she might be plotting to steal vegetables from Mr McGregor's garden.

[if !$avaliablePets.ada]
Someone else picked Ada already! Guess you'll have to pick a different companion.

:: Wingdings the Cat

# Windgings the Cat

Wingdings notices you approach and rolls over to expose his soft fluffy belly.
Is it a trap? Only one way to find out.

[if !$avaliablePets.wingdings]
Oh! It looks like someone else already decided to play with Wingdings. Darn.

:: Baskerville the Cat

# Baskerville the Cat

A stately and dignified black and white cat.
Baskerville sits up tall with his tail curled around his body.
He looks like he wants you to pet him, but is politely waiting his turn.

[if !$avaliablePets.baskerville]
Hang onâ€“someone else picked Baskerville already. Maybe next time.
